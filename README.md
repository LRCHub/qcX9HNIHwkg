[00:16.42] Please come now, I think I'm falling
[00:20.32] I'm holding on to all I think is safe
[00:24.50] It seems I found the road to nowhere
[00:28.63] And I'm trying to escape
[00:40.63] 
[00:32.25] I yelled back when I heard thunder
[00:36.10] But I'm down to one last breath
[00:40.32] And with it, let me say
[00:43.72] Let me say
[00:48.72] 
[00:47.25] Hold me now
[00:49.82] I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
[00:55.16] Maybe six feet ain't so far down
[01:11.16] 
[01:17.80] I'm looking down now that it's over
[01:21.90] Reflecting on all of my mistakes
[01:25.95] I thought I found the road to somewhere
[01:30.08] Somewhere in his grace
[01:41.08] 
[01:33.49] I cried out, Heaven save me
[01:37.45] But I'm down to one last breath
[01:41.24] And with it, let me say
[01:44.74] Let me say
[01:49.74] 
[01:48.14] Hold me now
[01:50.64] I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
[01:55.48] Maybe six feet ain't so far down
[02:11.48] 
[02:02.64] Hold me now
[02:05.21] I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
[02:10.18] Maybe six feet ain't so far down
[02:26.18] 
[02:20.02] I'm so far down
[02:27.52] 
[02:24.12] Sad eyes follow me
[02:30.14] But I still believe there's something left for me
[02:38.17] So please come stay with me
[02:44.77] 'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me
[02:50.59] For you and me
[02:51.78] For you and me
[02:58.78] 
[03:01.62] Hold me now
[03:04.02] I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
[03:25.52] 
[03:09.88] Hold me now
[03:12.58] I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
[03:17.30] Maybe six feet ain't so far down
[03:33.30] 
[03:24.50] Hold me now
[03:27.06] I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
[03:31.83] Maybe six feet ain't so far down
[03:47.83] 
[03:41.66] Please come now, I think I'm falling
[03:45.82] I'm holding on to all I think is safe
